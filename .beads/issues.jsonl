Need integration tests that validate full workflows without mocking everything.","notes":"\nDESIGN NOTES:\n\n**PROBLEM:**\nCurrent tests over-rely on mocks. While mocks are necessary for unit tests, integration tests should verify that components work together with minimal mocking, using real services where practical.\n\n**TESTING LEVELS:**\n1. **Unit Tests** (keep existing): Test isolated logic with heavy mocking\n2. **Integration Tests** (add): Test component interaction with minimal mocking\n3. **End-to-End Tests** (add): Test full workflows with real infrastructure\n\n**INTEGRATION TEST AREAS:**\n\n1. **Authentication \u0026 Authorization Flow:**\n   - Token generation → Validation → Policy enforcement\n   - Mock only external auth provider (OIDC), test internal auth\n   - Test real TSIDP or token auth mechanisms\n\n2. **Policy Gate Workflow:**\n   - Target registration → Capability checking → Operation validation\n   - Use real TargetRegistry, mock external SSH/Docker\n   - Test policy rules, validation logic\n\n3. **Discovery \u0026 Inventory:**\n   - Target discovery → Registration → Inventory query\n   - Test real discovery tools, mock target SSH\n   - Test inventory persistence with real database\n\n4. **Workflow Execution:**\n   - Workflow creation → Step execution → State tracking\n   - Test real workflow engine, mock target operations\n   - Test workflow persistence with real database\n\n5. **Security Monitoring:**\n   - Event generation → Audit logging → Alert generation\n   - Test real SecurityMonitor, use real database\n   - Test notification routing with real providers (email/webhook)\n\n**MINIMAL MOCKING STRATEGY:**\n- Mock external infrastructure (SSH to real targets, Docker API calls)\n- Mock third-party services (OIDC providers, external APIs)\n- Use real implementations for: Database, Policy logic, Validation, Discovery tools\n\n**FIXTURES FOR INTEGRATION TESTS:**\n\n\n**TEST STRUCTURE:**\nCreate tests/integration/ directory:\n- tests/integration/test_auth_integration.py\n- tests/integration/test_policy_gate_integration.py\n- tests/integration/test_discovery_integration.py\n- tests/integration/test_workflow_integration.py\n- tests/integration/test_security_monitoring_integration.py\n- tests/integration/test_inventory_integration.py\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:**\n1. Create tests/integration/ directory\n2. Implement integration test fixtures (real database, services)\n3. Write integration tests for each major workflow\n4. Use pytest.mark.integration marker\n5. Configure pytest to run integration tests separately\n6. Document how to run integration tests\n\n**INTEGRATION TEST EXAMPLE:**\n\n\n**TEST ENVIRONMENT:**\n- Use testcontainers for Docker-based services (PostgreSQL, Redis)\n- Use in-memory databases (aiosqlite with \":memory:\")\n- Use test fixtures for cleanup and isolation\n- Parallel test execution support\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Integration test suite created in tests/integration/\n- All major workflows tested end-to-end\n- Minimal mocking (only external dependencies)\n- Real database operations tested\n- Real service logic tested (PolicyGate, TargetRegistry, etc.)\n- Tests use pytest.mark.integration marker\n- Tests can run independently (no cross-test dependencies)\n- Integration tests pass consistently\n- Code coverage from integration tests \u003e 30% (incremental)\n- Documentation shows how to run integration tests\n- CI/CD pipeline includes integration test execution\n- Performance targets met (\u003c 5s per integration test)\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-26T16:32:08.258752603Z","updated_at":"2025-12-27T14:42:54.936171269Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"TailOpsMCP-4bn","depends_on_id":"TailOpsMCP-j2x","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-26T16:32:39.709522883Z","created_by":"daemon"}]}
